            <h2>1. What are Cookies?</h2>
            <p>Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. They are widely used to make websites work more efficiently, as well as to provide information to the owners of the site. Cookies serve various functions, such as remembering your login details, storing your preferences, and helping us analyze how our website is used. They can be "session cookies" which are temporary and deleted when you close your browser, or "persistent cookies" which remain on your device for a set period or until you delete them. The information stored in cookies can be read by the website that placed them, allowing the site to recognize your browser and remember your past actions or preferences. This makes your subsequent visits more convenient and personalized. Cookies are an integral part of modern web browsing, enabling many of the features we take for granted, from keeping items in a shopping cart to delivering personalized content. They are generally harmless and do not contain viruses or malware. However, understanding their purpose and how to manage them is crucial for maintaining your online privacy.</p>

            <h2>2. How ChatoriCode Uses Cookies</h2>
            <p>At ChatoriCode, we use cookies for a variety of purposes to enhance your browsing experience, personalize content, analyze site performance, and deliver relevant advertisements. Our use of cookies is designed to make your time on our Website more enjoyable and efficient, while also helping us understand how we can improve our services. We categorize our cookies to help you understand their function and your choices. Below, we detail the specific ways cookies contribute to your ChatoriCode experience, ensuring transparency in our data practices. We are committed to using cookies responsibly and in accordance with applicable data protection regulations. Each cookie serves a specific role, contributing to the overall functionality and user-friendliness of our platform. We continuously review our cookie usage to ensure it aligns with best practices and respects your privacy preferences. Our aim is to provide a seamless and tailored experience, from remembering your preferred recipes to analyzing site traffic patterns for continuous improvement.</p>

            <h3>3. Types of Cookies Used on ChatoriCode and Their Purpose (40 Detailed Points)</h3>

            <h4>3.1. Strictly Necessary Cookies (Essential Cookies)</h4>
            <p>These cookies are fundamental for the operation of our Website and cannot be switched off in our systems. They are usually only set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in, or filling in forms. You can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but some parts of the site will not then work. These cookies do not store any personally identifiable information.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Session Management:</strong>
                    <p>These cookies are crucial for maintaining your session as you navigate through different pages of the Website. Without them, the Website would treat you as a new visitor on every page, making it impossible to stay logged in or remember your selections as you browse. They ensure continuity of your experience, allowing you to move seamlessly from one section to another without re-authenticating. This is vital for any interactive features, like saving recipes to a "Chatori Box" or interacting with a search filter.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>User Authentication:</strong>
                    <p>When you log into your ChatoriCode account, authentication cookies are set to verify your identity and keep you logged in. This prevents you from having to enter your credentials every time you visit a new page or return to the site within a certain period. These cookies are encrypted to protect your login information and are essential for accessing personalized features and content on your profile.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Security Measures:</strong>
                    <p>Certain cookies are used to implement security features, such as detecting repeated failed login attempts or identifying unusual activity that could indicate a security threat. They help protect your account from unauthorized access and ensure the overall security of our Website's infrastructure. These cookies are critical for maintaining the integrity and safety of our platform and user data.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Load Balancing:</strong>
                    <p>These cookies distribute network traffic across multiple servers to optimize website performance and ensure stability. If ChatoriCode experiences high traffic, load balancing cookies ensure that your requests are routed to the most available server, preventing slowdowns and ensuring a consistent user experience. They are transparent to the user but vital for site reliability.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Cookie Consent Preferences:</strong>
                    <p>When you make a choice regarding cookie acceptance (e.g., accepting all, declining, or customizing preferences), a cookie is set to remember your decision. This prevents the cookie consent banner from reappearing on every visit and ensures your preferences are respected across sessions. This cookie is essential for compliance with privacy regulations.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Form Submission Retention:</strong>
                    <p>If you fill out a form on our Website (e.g., contact form, recipe submission), some cookies might temporarily store your input to prevent data loss if you navigate away or refresh the page before submitting. This enhances user convenience and prevents frustration from lost information during interactive processes.</p>

            <h4>3.4. Targeting / Advertising Cookies</h4>
            <p>These cookies may be set through our site by our advertising partners. They may be used by those companies to build a profile of your interests and show you relevant adverts on other sites. They do not store directly personal information but are based on uniquely identifying your browser and internet device. If you do not allow these cookies, you will experience less targeted advertising.</p>
            <ol start="31">
                <li>
                    <strong>Interest-Based Advertising:</strong>
                    <p>These cookies collect information about your browsing habits and interests on ChatoriCode and other websites to build a profile of your preferences. This profile is then used by advertising networks to show you advertisements that are more relevant to your likely interests across different websites and platforms, making ads more personalized.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Ad Campaign Performance Measurement:</strong>
                    <p>Advertising cookies help us and our partners measure the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns. They track how many times an ad is shown, how many users click on it, and whether those clicks lead to desired actions (e.g., visiting a recipe page, signing up for a newsletter). This allows us to optimize our ad spending.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Frequency Capping:</strong>
                    <p>These cookies prevent you from seeing the same advertisement too many times. By tracking how often a specific ad has been displayed to your browser, they help ensure a less repetitive and more pleasant ad experience for users, while also optimizing ad delivery for advertisers.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Retargeting/Remarketing:</strong>
                    <p>If you visit a specific recipe page or category on ChatoriCode, retargeting cookies might be used to show you ads related to that content on other websites you visit. For example, if you viewed "Masala Fries Tower," you might see ads for related snack ingredients or kitchen gadgets later.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Audience Segmentation:</strong>
                    <p>Advertising cookies contribute to segmenting our audience into groups based on shared interests or behaviors (e.g., "spicy food lovers," "quick recipe seekers"). Advertisers can then target specific segments with highly relevant messages, improving the efficiency of their campaigns and the relevance of ads to users.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Cross-Device Tracking (Probabilistic):</strong>
                    <p>While not identifying you personally, some advertising cookies and technologies attempt to infer that different devices (e.g., your phone and laptop) belong to the same user. This allows for more consistent ad delivery across your devices, even if you're not logged into the same account on each.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Affiliate Marketing Tracking:</strong>
                    <p>If ChatoriCode participates in affiliate marketing programs (e.g., linking to cooking product retailers), these cookies track whether a user clicked on an affiliate link on our site and subsequently made a purchase on the partner's site. This allows us to earn commissions for referrals.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Social Media Advertising Integration:</strong>
                    <p>Cookies from social media platforms (e.g., Facebook Pixel) are used to understand user behavior on our site and then deliver targeted ads to those users on the respective social media platforms. This helps us reach relevant audiences with our content and promotions on social channels.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Third-Party Data Enrichment:</strong>
                    <p>Some advertising partners may combine data collected via cookies on our site with other data they have about you from various sources. This allows them to create a more comprehensive profile for ad targeting, leading to highly personalized (and sometimes surprising) advertisements.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Ad Personalization Opt-Out Mechanisms:</strong>
                    <p>These cookies sometimes store your preferences if you've opted out of personalized advertising through industry-standard opt-out tools (e.g., DAA, NAI). This ensures that your choice to receive less targeted advertising is respected by participating ad networks across different websites.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h4>3.5. Other Tracking Technologies</h4>
            <p>Beyond traditional cookies, ChatoriCode may also use other similar technologies, such as web beacons (also known as clear GIFs or pixel tags) and local storage objects (LSOs) like Flash cookies. These technologies serve similar purposes to cookies but may store more data or function differently.</p>
            <ol start="41">
                <li>
                    <strong>Web Beacons/Pixel Tags:</strong>
                    <p>These are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on web pages or in emails and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. They help us count users who have visited certain pages or opened emails and gather other related website statistics.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Local Storage Objects (LSOs) - Flash Cookies:</strong>
                    <p>Flash cookies are data files that can be created on your computer by the sites you visit. They are often used in conjunction with Flash content (e.g., embedded videos or games) to store user preferences or game progress. Unlike regular cookies, Flash cookies can store much more data and are not typically managed through browser settings. You may need to manage them through Adobe Flash Player settings.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Local Storage (HTML5):</strong>
                    <p>Modern web browsers offer "local storage" (also known as HTML5 local storage), which allows websites to store data directly in the browser. This storage is persistent, meaning the data remains even after the browser is closed, similar to persistent cookies, but with a larger storage capacity. We might use this for remembering UI preferences or temporary data for features.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Session Storage (HTML5):</strong>
                    <p>Similar to local storage, "session storage" allows websites to store data in the browser, but this data is cleared when the browser session ends (i.e., when the browser tab or window is closed). This is useful for temporary data that needs to persist only for the duration of a single browsing session, such as form inputs or temporary user selections.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>ETags (Entity Tags):</strong>
                    <p>ETags are a mechanism used by web servers to determine if a component of a web page (like an image or a script) in a browser's cache matches the version on the server. While primarily for caching efficiency, they can sometimes be used as a form of tracking, as they can act as unique identifiers that persist across sessions, even if traditional cookies are cleared.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Browser Fingerprinting:</strong>
                    <p>This is a more advanced tracking technique that collects information about your web browser and device (e.g., browser type, version, operating system, plugins, fonts, screen resolution). This unique combination of attributes can be used to create a "fingerprint" that identifies your device, even without traditional cookies. While we don't actively employ this for tracking, it's a known technology in the web landscape.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Device Identifiers:</strong>
                    <p>When you access ChatoriCode via a mobile app (if applicable), we may collect unique device identifiers (e.g., advertising IDs like IDFA for iOS or Android Advertising ID). These are used for advertising, analytics, and personalization within the app environment, similar to how cookies function on websites.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>IP Address Tracking:</strong>
                    <p>Your IP address, while not a cookie, is automatically collected by web servers. It can indicate your general geographic location and is used for security, fraud prevention, and aggregated geographical analytics. While not a persistent identifier for tracking per se, it's fundamental to how internet communication works.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Referrer URLs:</strong>
                    <p>The "referrer URL" is the address of the webpage that linked you to ChatoriCode. This information is passed by your browser and helps us understand where our traffic comes from. It's not stored in a cookie but is part of the standard HTTP request, offering insights into user acquisition paths.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Server Logs:</strong>
                    <p>Our web servers automatically record information about your visit in log files. This includes your IP address, browser type, operating system, pages visited, time of visit, and referring URL. While not a cookie, this data is crucial for website maintenance, security, and performance analysis, providing a comprehensive record of site activity.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
