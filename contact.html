                <p>A: We love featuring the culinary creativity of our community! Currently, we are developing a dedicated recipe submission portal. In the meantime, if you have a unique fast food, fusion snack, or street-style recipe that aligns with the ChatoriCode vibe, please send us a brief description and any accompanying photos or videos via our contact form.

                <h3>Q: Are the recipes suitable for specific dietary restrictions (e.g., vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free)?</h3>
                <p>A: While many of our recipes are naturally vegetarian due to the nature of Indian street food, we are actively working on adding specific tags and filters to help users easily find recipes that fit their dietary needs (e.g., "Vegan," "Gluten-Free options"). Currently, we recommend reviewing the ingredient list of each recipe carefully. We also provide tips for substitutions in many recipes to help you adapt them to your preferences. Our goal is to make ChatoriCode inclusive for all food lovers.</p>
