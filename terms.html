By providing any User Contribution on the Website, you grant us and our affiliates and service providers, and each of their and our respective licensees, successors, and assigns the right to use, reproduce, modify, perform, display, distribute, and otherwise disclose to third parties any such material for any purpose. You represent and warrant that: (a) You own or control all rights in and to the User Contributions and have the right to grant the license granted above to us and our affiliates and service providers, and each of their and our respective licensees, successors, and assigns. (b) All of your User Contributions do and will comply with these Terms. You understand and acknowledge that you are responsible for any User Contributions you submit or contribute, and you, not ChatoriCode, have full responsibility for such content, including its legality, reliability, accuracy, and appropriateness. We are not responsible or liable to any third party for the content or accuracy of any User Contributions posted by you or any other user of the Website. This section outlines the responsibilities and rights associated with user-generated content on ChatoriCode. It clarifies that while users retain ownership of their contributions, they grant us a broad license to use and display such content on the platform. Crucially, it places the full responsibility for the legality and appropriateness of User Contributions squarely on the user, while absolving ChatoriCode of liability for third-party content. This framework is essential for managing user-generated content effectively, promoting responsible participation, and maintaining a high standard of community interaction on our Website.</p>

(c) Infringe any patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or other intellectual property or other rights of any other person.

(n) Be used to send unsolicited or unauthorized advertising or promotional material, or any other form of similar solicitation (spam). This section establishes clear and comprehensive guidelines for all user-generated content on ChatoriCode. It sets a high bar for appropriate and lawful contributions, prohibiting content that is harmful, offensive, illegal, or infringes upon intellectual property rights. By outlining these standards, we aim to foster a safe, respectful, and high-quality environment for all users, ensuring that interactions remain positive and constructive. Adherence to these content standards is crucial for maintaining the integrity of our community and upholding our commitment to a responsible online platform.</p>

            <h2>9. Monitoring and Enforcement; Termination</h2>
            <p>We have the right to: (a) Remove or refuse to post any User Contributions for any or no reason in our sole discretion. (b) Take any action with respect to any User Contribution that we deem necessary or appropriate in our sole discretion, including if we believe that such User Contribution violates the Terms, including the Content Standards, infringes any intellectual property right or other right of any person or entity, threatens the personal safety of users of the Website or the public, or could create liability for ChatoriCode. (c) Disclose your identity or other information about you to any third party who claims that material posted by you violates their rights, including their intellectual property rights or their right to privacy. (d) Take appropriate legal action, including without limitation, referral to law enforcement, for any illegal or unauthorized use of the Website.

YOU WAIVE AND HOLD HARMLESS CHATORICODE AND ITS AFFILIATES, LICENSEES, AND SERVICE PROVIDERS FROM ANY CLAIMS RESULTING FROM ANY ACTION TAKEN BY CHATORICODE DURING, OR TAKEN AS A CONSEQUENCE OF, INVESTIGATIONS BY EITHER CHATORICODE OR LAW ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES. However, we do not undertake to review all material before it is posted on the Website, and cannot ensure prompt removal of objectionable material after it has been posted. Accordingly, we assume no liability for any action or inaction regarding transmissions, communications, or content provided by any user or third party. We have no liability or responsibility to anyone for performance or nonperformance of the activities described in this section. This section grants ChatoriCode broad rights to monitor, manage, and enforce its Terms of Service, including the ability to remove content, suspend or terminate user accounts, and cooperate with law enforcement. It clarifies that while we have these rights, we do not guarantee immediate removal of all objectionable material and are not liable for user-generated content. This framework is essential for maintaining a safe and compliant online environment, empowering us to take necessary actions to protect the platform and its users from harmful or unlawful activities, while also limiting our liability for the actions of individual users.</p>

This comprehensive disclaimer is essential for managing legal exposure and setting realistic expectations for users regarding the performance and reliability of the Website.

            <h2>12. Limitation on Liability</h2>
            <p>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PROVIDED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL CHATORICODE, ITS AFFILIATES, OR THEIR LICENSORS, SERVICE PROVIDERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, OFFICERS, OR DIRECTORS BE LIABLE FOR DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, UNDER ANY LEGAL THEORY, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE, OR INABILITY TO USE, THE WEBSITE, ANY WEBSITES LINKED TO IT, ANY CONTENT ON THE WEBSITE OR SUCH OTHER WEBSITES, INCLUDING ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PERSONAL INJURY, PAIN AND SUFFERING, EMOTIONAL DISTRESS, LOSS OF REVENUE, LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF BUSINESS OR ANTICIPATED SAVINGS, LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF GOODWILL, LOSS OF DATA, AND WHETHER CAUSED BY TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), BREACH OF CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF FORESEEABLE. THE FOREGOING DOES NOT AFFECT ANY LIABILITY THAT CANNOT BE EXCLUDED OR LIMITED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW. This section is a crucial limitation of liability clause, designed to protect ChatoriCode, its affiliates, and associated parties from extensive financial and legal responsibility for damages arising from the use or inability to use the Website. It specifies that liability is limited to the fullest extent permitted by law, covering various types of damages. This clause is fundamental for managing our risk exposure and ensuring that our operations remain sustainable. It sets clear boundaries for our legal obligations to users, emphasizing that while we strive to provide a valuable service, there are inherent limitations to our liability, particularly for indirect or consequential damages. This is a standard legal provision in online service agreements.</p>

            <h2>13. Indemnification</h2>
            <p>You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless ChatoriCode, its affiliates, licensors, and service providers, and its and their respective officers, directors, employees, contractors, agents, licensors, suppliers, successors, and assigns from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, judgments, awards, losses, costs, expenses, or fees (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or relating to your violation of these Terms or your use of the Website, including, but not limited to, your User Contributions, any use of the Website's content, services, and products other than as expressly authorized in these Terms, or your use of any information obtained from the Website. This indemnification clause is a vital protective measure for ChatoriCode. It requires you, the user, to compensate and protect ChatoriCode and its associated parties from any legal claims, liabilities, or expenses that arise from your breach of these Terms or your misuse of the Website. This ensures that if your actions lead to legal repercussions for ChatoriCode, you are responsible for covering the costs. This is a standard and essential provision in online service agreements, designed to mitigate the risks associated with user misconduct and to safeguard the platform's operational and financial stability.</p>

            <h2>14. Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h2>
            <p>All matters relating to the Website and these Terms, and any dispute or claim arising therefrom or related thereto (in each case, including non-contractual disputes or claims), shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of India without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule. Any legal suit, action, or proceeding arising out of, or related to, these Terms or the Website shall be instituted exclusively in the courts of Delhi, India, although we retain the right to bring any suit, action, or proceeding against you for breach of these Terms in your country of residence or any other relevant country. You waive any and all objections to the exercise of jurisdiction over you by such courts and to venue in such courts. This section clearly defines the legal framework that governs the relationship between you and ChatoriCode. It specifies that the laws of India will apply to any disputes and that legal actions must be brought exclusively in the courts of Delhi, India. This provides legal certainty and streamlines the process for resolving potential conflicts, ensuring that both parties understand the applicable legal jurisdiction. It is a fundamental clause for establishing legal predictability and managing litigation risks for the platform.</p>

            <h2>15. Entire Agreement</h2>
            <p>The Terms of Service, our Privacy Policy, and Cookie Policy constitute the sole and entire agreement between you and ChatoriCode regarding the Website and supersede all prior and contemporaneous understandings, agreements, representations, and warranties, both written and oral, regarding the Website. This section, known as the "Entire Agreement" clause, states that these Terms, along with the Privacy Policy and Cookie Policy, represent the complete and final agreement between you and ChatoriCode concerning your use of the Website. It explicitly supersedes any prior discussions, agreements, or understandings, whether written or oral. This is a standard legal provision designed to prevent future disputes over what was agreed upon, ensuring that only the terms within these specified documents are legally binding. It provides clarity and finality to the contractual relationship between the user and ChatoriCode.</p>

            <h2>16. Severability</h2>
            <p>If any provision of these Terms is held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of the Terms will continue in full force and effect. This "Severability" clause ensures that if any part of these Terms is found to be legally invalid or unenforceable, the rest of the agreement remains fully in effect. It prevents the entire Terms of Service from being nullified due to a defect in a single provision. This is a common and important legal safeguard that helps maintain the enforceability of the overall agreement, even if specific clauses are challenged or found to be problematic in a legal context. It contributes to the robustness and longevity of the legal framework governing the Website's use.</p>
