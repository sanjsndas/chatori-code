            <p>The security of your personal information is very important to us. We have implemented reasonable administrative, technical, and physical measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure. These measures include, but are not limited to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> We use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology to encrypt data transmitted between your browser and our servers, particularly for sensitive information like login credentials.</li>
                <li><strong>Access Controls:</strong> Access to your personal information is restricted to authorized employees, contractors, and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop, or improve our services. All such individuals are subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.</li>
                <li><strong>Regular Security Audits:</strong> We regularly review our information collection, storage, and processing practices, including physical security measures, to guard against unauthorized access to systems.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Minimization:</strong> We strive to collect only the personal information that is necessary for the purposes for which it is processed, reducing the risk associated with data breaches.</li>
                <li><strong>Anonymization and Pseudonymization:</strong> Where feasible, we anonymize or pseudonymize data to protect your identity while still allowing us to perform analytics and improve our services.</li>

                <li><strong>Incident Response Plan:</strong> We have a robust incident response plan in place to address any potential data breaches quickly and effectively, minimizing harm and ensuring compliance with notification requirements.</li>

            </ul>
            <p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure.

Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Website.</p>

            <h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
            <p>We retain personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.</p>
            <p>For example, if you have an account with us, we will retain your account information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services.

            <p>To exercise the rights described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by contacting us via the methods provided in the "Contact Information" section below. Only you, or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information.

We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make the request.</p>
